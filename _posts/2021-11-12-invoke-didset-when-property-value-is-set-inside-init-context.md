Property observers are only called when the propertyâ€™s value is set outside of initialization context.

`defer` can change situation ðŸ˜Š

```
class Member {
    var ageMember: Int! {
        didSet {
            print("Function: \(#function)")
        }
    }

    init(age: Int) {
        self.ageMember = age
    }
}

class User {
    var ageUser: Int! {
        didSet {
            print("Function: \(#function)")
        }
    }

    init(age: Int) {
        defer {
            self.ageUser = age
        }
    }
}

Function: ageUser
```
